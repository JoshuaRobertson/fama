# :boom: Fama: Slack Status Updates

Set your Slack status directly from the Fama app.

## :pushpin: Summary

The name Fama is the Latin translation for "**report**". I picked it because it's short and sounds cool ðŸ¤“.

The app makes use of Slack's API, and focuses on the [custom status](https://api.slack.com/docs/presence-and-status#custom_status) options.

**Please note:** you will need your Slack profile's API key.

## :wrench: Development

To develop locally you'll need the following installed:

- [Netlify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netlify)

Once installed you can start the project with:

```bash
$ netlify dev
```
This will open the project in a new browser tab and accessible via [localhost](http://localhost:8888).
